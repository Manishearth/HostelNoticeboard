9. TalkBack Feature Notice :  The TalkBack feature, included with the
Software, enables Altera to receive limited information concerning the
Software that Licensee uses and Licensee's compilation of logic
designs (but not the logic design files themselves) using the
Software.  One of the primary purposes of the TalkBack feature is to
assist Altera in understanding how its customers use the Software and
Altera's other products, so more effort can be placed on improving the
features most important to users.  To disable/enable the TalkBack
feature, run qtb_install.exe located in Licensee's quartus/bin folder.

INFORMATION COLLECTED
The only information that Altera will receive through the TalkBack
feature is the information listed below.  No design files will be
collected or transmitted through the TalkBack feature.

Logic design compilation information regarding the following
categories will be collected: constraints (e.g., location assignments,
clock and timing requirement and assignments, any constraints set via
the Quartus? II graphical user interface), device (e.g., targeted
device and family), compilation (e.g., device, memory and I/O
utilization, time of compilation), design (e.g., the number of each
type of file used and name of top file, intellectual property
cores/MegaCore(r) logic functions used), software tools (e.g.,
synthesis, simulation and timing analysis tools used and version and
build of the Software), platform (e.g., operating system, speed and
number of processors and main memory), license file identification
number (T-Guard, host ID, NIC ID or C: drive), graphical user
interface activities and software errors log (e.g., previous exit
status).

TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION
The TalkBack feature functions by bundling the collected information
resulting from Licensee's installation and/or execution of the
Software and each logic design compilation and writing it to XML files
which are transmitted to Altera's external web server by https
(hypertext transfer protocol secure) post.

The TalkBack feature will only maintain up to fifteen (15) files at
any given time, i.e., the last five (5) sent files and up to ten (10)
unsent files.  As new files are created, prior files (whether or not
previously transmitted) will be deleted.  Each saved file will be less
than 500 KB in size and can be viewed as text files found in
Licensee's temporary directory on Licensee's hard drive (typically in
/tmp, c:/temp, or c:\documents and setting\username\local
settings\temp).

If an https post transmission fails, or an internet connection is not
available at the time of installation, execution or compilation, the
information is stored as an XML file.  Once an internet connection is
achieved by Licensee, the https post transmission will again be
attempted upon a successful compilation.  The TalkBack feature will
not initiate an internet connection.  Files that have not been
successfully transmitted will be named "quartus_talkback*.xml", while
successfully transmitted files will be renamed as
"sent_quartus_talkback*.xml."

The collection and bundling of information by the TalkBack feature
will not materially affect the installation, compilation time or the
performance of the Software.

Altera uses reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of the
transmitted information.  However, due to technological limitations,
and the risk of unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions
and/or data, Altera cannot completely assure Licensee, and Licensee
should not expect, that the information will be absolutely protected
or confidential.  Once received, the transmitted information is
protected from outside Altera by "firewalls."

Should Licensee attempt to tamper with or modify any installation of
the Software in any way (other than as permitted herein or by
Licensee's license), Altera does not take any responsibility regarding
the operation of the TalkBack feature, or the collection and
transmission of data as described herein.

NON-DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED; USE OF INFORMATION
The information collected by the TalkBack feature will not be
disclosed by Altera to any third parties other than its subsidiaries
and the company on behalf of whom Licensee is using the Quartus II
software (collectively, "Partners").  Once the collected data is
received by Altera within its firewall, Altera may correlate the data
collected by the TalkBack feature to determine the identity of the
user and utilize this information internally only on a confidential
basis.  Altera also seeks to require its Partners to exercise
reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the information.


The information collected by the TalkBack feature will only be used by
Altera and its Partners for marketing and sales research, product
planning and software development purposes (for example, solving
software problems, optimizing software processing and designing future
products to Licensee's needs).    This information will not be used to
send Licensee any sales and marketing communications, and Altera will
only send Licensee such information if Licensee has previously
provided Licensee's consent to receive such communications.  If
Licensee does not wish to receive sales and marketing communications,
Licensee may contact webmaster@altera.com.  In that case, Altera will
use reasonable efforts to promptly remove Licensee from such lists.

EUROPEAN USERS OF THE SOFTWARE: Please note that the TalkBack feature
will collect and provide certain personally identifiable information
to Altera.  By agreeing to this Agreement, Licensee hereby gives
Licensee's consent for Altera to use this information both within and
outside of the European Union for the purposes described in this
TalkBack disclosure notice.

ACCESS TO INFORMATION BY ISPS
Through the https post procedure, Licensee's and Altera's Internet
Service Providers will also receive the information collected by the
TalkBack feature.  However, ALTERA'S ISP does not disclose, share,
release, publish, disseminate, rent or sell any of the information to
any third parties. Licensee should contact Licensee's ISP to determine
their disclosure policies.

REQUIRED DISCLOSURES
In addition to the permitted disclosures described herein, and
regardless of anything herein to the contrary, Altera may disclose
personally identifiable information (collected by the TalkBack feature
and correlated to users), with or without prior notice, when Altera
believes that the law requires it, in response to subpoenas or at the
demand of governmental agencies, to protect its systems or business,
or to respond to an emergency.

ASSIGNMENT
Altera reserves the right to transfer any and all information
collected by the TalkBack feature from users of the Software to a
third party in the event that it sells or transfers substantially all
of its assets related to the Software to such third party.

DISABLING/ENABLING
Licensee may disable/enable the TalkBack feature at any time by
running qtb_install.exe located in Licensee's quartus/bin folder.

10.	Quartus II Notifications Feature Notice : The Quartus II
notifications feature, included with the Licensed Program(s), enables
ALTERA to receive limited information concerning the Licensed
Program(s) that you use and your compilation of logic designs (but not
the logic design files themselves) using the Licensed Program(s). The
primary purpose of the Quartus II notifications feature is to help
users monitor their compliations from any location and receive
notifications when their jobs complete. To disable/enable the Quartus
II notifications feature, individual users may make the appropriate
setting in the Quartus II software "Options > Internet Connectivity >
Notifications" dialog box. Administrators may also, at install time,
deselect the entire feature to prevent the feature from being exposed
to their users in corporate or team environments.

INFORMATION COLLECTED
The only information that ALTERA will receive through the Quartus II
notifications feature is the information listed below. No design files
will be collected or transmitted through the Quartus II notifications
feature.

The following information may be transmitted to a cloud server, either
hosted by ALTERA or an ALTERA service provider, to enable the feature
from the Quartus II software: project revision name, local computer
hostname, progress tracking information (such as the percentage
complete for the overall compile as well as individual Quartus II
executable stages), and critical warnings or error messages.

TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION
The Quartus II notifications feature functions by periodically sending
status information resulting from the execution of the Licensed
Program(s) and each logic design compilation and sending them to
ALTERA'S external web server by https (hypertext transfer protocol
secure) network connections.  The Quartus II software must be
preconfigured with the user's ALTERA cloud user account (available to
any customer by registering at https://cloud.altera.com with a valid
email address) for the feature to work. If the user's ALTERA cloud
account is deleted or revoked, then the Quartus II software will not
send any status information for the Quartus II notifications feature
to the ALTERA cloud server.

If an https transmission fails, or an internet connection is not
available at the time of execution or compilation, the Quartus II
notifications feature will abandon attempts to send the status
information during the remaining course of the compilation. The
collection and bundling of information by the Quartus II notifications
feature will not materially affect the installation, compilation time
or the performance of the Licensed Program(s).

ALTERA uses reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of the
transmitted information. However, due to technological limitations,
and the risk of unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions
and/or data, ALTERA cannot completely assure you, and you should not
expect, that the information will be absolutely protected or
confidential. Once received, the transmitted information is protected
from outside ALTERA by "firewalls."

Should you attempt to tamper with or modify any installation of the
Licensed Program(s) in any way (other than as permitted herein or by
your license), ALTERA does not take any responsibility regarding the
operation of the Quartus II notifications feature, or the collection
and transmission of data as described herein.

ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON THE ALTERA CLOUD SITE
All users have the ability to view the compile data transmitted by
logging into the https://cloud.altera.com ALTERA cloud site with the
same user account specified when enabling the Quartus II notifications
feature.  From this site, users can browse the compile status data, or
delete/purge results as they wish.

NON-DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED; USE OF INFORMATION
The information collected by the Quartus II notifications feature will
not be disclosed by ALTERA to any third parties other than as
necessary for the purposes described in this Quartus II notifications
disclosure notice, including third-party providers, its subsidiaries
and the company on behalf of whom you are using the Quartus II
software (collectively, Partners) . Once the collected data is
received by ALTERA within their firewall, ALTERA may correlate the
data collected by the Quartus II notifications feature to determine
the identity of the user and utilize this information internally only
on a confidential basis. ALTERA also seeks to require its Partners to
exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the
information.

The information collected by the Quartus II notifications feature will
only be used by ALTERA and its Partners for marketing and sales
research , product planning and software development purposes (for
example, solving software problems, optimizing software processing and
designing future products to your needs). This information will not be
used to send you any sales and marketing communications, and ALTERA
will only send you such information if you have previously provided
your consent to receive such communications. If you do not wish to
receive sales and marketing communications, you may contact
webmaster@altera.com. In that case, we will use reasonable efforts to
promptly remove you from such lists.

Providers will also receive the information collected by the Quartus
II notifications feature. However, ALTERA'S ISP does not disclose,
share, release, publish, disseminate, rent or sell any of the
information to any third parties. You should contact your ISP to
determine their disclosure policies.

REQUIRED DISCLOSURES
In addition to the permitted disclosures described herein, and
regardless of anything herein to the contrary, ALTERA may disclose
personally identifiable information (collected by the Quartus II
notifications feature and correlated to users), with or without prior
notice, when ALTERA believes that the law requires it, in response to
subpoenas or at the demand of governmental agencies, to protect its
systems or business, or to respond to an emergency.

ASSIGNMENT
ALTERA reserves the right to transfer any and all information
collected by the Quartus II notifications feature from users of the
Licensed Program(s) to a third party in the event that it sells or
transfers substantially all of its assets related to the Licensed
Program(s) to such third party.

DISABLING/ENABLING
The Quartus II notifications feature may be deselected at install time
to allow administrators to prevent the feature from being exposed to

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,
so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the
original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at
all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.


		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number
of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two
goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software
and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT
WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK
AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it
does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published
by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
`show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use
may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even
be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James
Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

If you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading
one or
more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in
roughly
the order listed) before diving into the code.


OVERVIEW
========

This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression
and
decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized
compression
method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for
compressing
"real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic
images
are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image
is not
exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if
you
have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic
images,
very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change,
and
remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a
low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just
experiment
with various compression settings.

This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and
progressive
compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants
of these
processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't
implemented yet.
For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the
arithmetic-coding
variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for
supporting
the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.

We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG
image files,
plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the
library to
perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file
formats.
The library is intended to be reused in other applications.

In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have
included
considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding
capability;
for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of
JPEG
decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file
formats or
colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of
the
library if not required for a particular application.  We have also
included
"jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG
processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for
inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.

The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving
portability and
flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In
particular,
the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See
the
REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended
to
be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to
have
achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for
it.

We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial
products.
No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product
documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter
Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo
Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but
instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation;
principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the
file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed
as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you
more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It
is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely
distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is
covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding
cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this
reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG
software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the
unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will
support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the
remaining
code.

WARNING: Unisys has begun to enforce their patent on LZW compression
against
GIF encoders and decoders.  You will need a license from Unisys to use
the
included rdgif.c or wrgif.c files in a commercial or shareware
application.
At this time, Unisys is not enforcing their patent against freeware,
so
distribution of this package remains legal.  However, we intend to
remove
GIF support from the IJG package as soon as a suitable replacement
format
becomes reasonably popular.

REFERENCES
==========

We highly recommend reading one or more of these references before
trying to
understand the innards of the JPEG software.

The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression
algorithm is
	Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
	Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture
compression,
applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM
issue
handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's
article
is available at ftp.uu.net, graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file
(actually
a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer
Electronics)
omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes
corrections
and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM
and
IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial purposes.

A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be
found in
"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson, published by M&T Books
(Redwood
City, CA), 1991, ISBN 1-55851-216-0.  This book provides good
explanations and
example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG.
It is
an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't
know much
about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG sample code is far
from
industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full
implementation,
you've got one here...

The best full description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still Image
Data
Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell,
published
by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95,
638 pp.
The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS
10918-1
and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition
of JPEG
in existence, and we highly recommend it.

The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must
order a
paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a
certified
official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book
instead;
it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory
material.)
In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at
(212)
642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.
(ANSI
doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as
of
1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%
shipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1
being the
actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.
Part 1
is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still
Images,
Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC
IS
10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding
of
Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has
document
numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.

Extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3, a
new ISO
document.  Part 3 is undergoing ISO balloting and is expected to be
approved
by the end of 1995; it will have document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-3,
ITU-T
T.84.  IJG currently does not support any Part 3 extensions.

The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable
file
format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions,
revision
1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:
	Literature Department
	C-Cube Microsystems, Inc.
	1778 McCarthy Blvd.
	Milpitas, CA 95035
	phone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314
A PostScript version of this document is available at ftp.uu.net, file
graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  It can also be obtained by e-mail from the
C-Cube
mail server, netlib@c3.pla.ca.us.  Send the message "send jfif_ps from
jpeg"
to the server to obtain the JFIF document; send the message "help" if
you have
trouble.

The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
sgi.com
(192.48.153.1), file graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.Z; or you can order a
printed
copy from Aldus Corp. at (206) 628-6593.  The JPEG incorporation
scheme
found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious
problems.
IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression
tag 6).
Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note
#2
(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from sgi.com
or
from ftp.uu.net:/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next
revision of
the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff
library
uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is
available
from sgi.com:/graphics/tiff/.


ARCHIVE LOCATIONS
=================

The "official" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet
address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be
found
there in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be
archived
as graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6a.tar.gz.  If you are on the Internet, you
can retrieve files from ftp.uu.net by standard anonymous FTP.  If you
don't
have FTP access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact
help@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.

Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However,
only
ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.

You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible "zip" archive
format from
the SimTel archives (ftp.coast.net:/SimTel/msdos/graphics/), or on
CompuServe
in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12 "JPEG
Tools".
Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net release.

The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source
of
general information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and
therefore is
not included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks
to
Usenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.
You can always obtain the latest version from the news.answers archive
at
rtfm.mit.edu.  By FTP, fetch /pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1
and
.../part2.  If you don't have FTP, send e-mail to
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
with body
	send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1
	send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2


RELATED SOFTWARE
================

Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.
(Quite a
few of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above
lists
some of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where
to
obtain them on Internet.

If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free
PBMPLUS image software, which provides many useful operations on
PPM-format
image files.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a
wide
range of other formats.  You can obtain this package by FTP from
ftp.x.org
(contrib/pbmplus*.tar.Z) or ftp.ee.lbl.gov (pbmplus*.tar.Z).  There is
also
a newer update of this package called NETPBM, available from
wuarchive.wustl.edu under directory
/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.
Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG
software
is; you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix
machine.

A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at
Stanford,
is available from havefun.stanford.edu in directory pub/jpeg.  This
program
is designed for research and experimentation rather than production
use;
it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but
it
is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless
JPEG,
which we do not.


FILE FORMAT WARS
================

Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our
library.
The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to
specify a
concrete file format.  Some vendors "filled in the blanks" on their
own,
creating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For
example, none
of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were
able to
exchange compressed files.)

The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This
format
has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and
it has
become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or "low end"
representation.
We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by
TIFF
Technical Note #2) for "high end" applications that need to record a
lot of
additional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet
widely
supported, unfortunately.

The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF.
SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders
should
be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some
technical
advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is
an
official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is
unclear
whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the
de-facto
standard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen,
but we
have not decided whether it should become our default output format or
not.
(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF
indefinitely.)

Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also
exist.
We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.
Indeed,
one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to
help
force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.
Don't
use a proprietary file format!


TO DO
=====

In future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming
JPEG
Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF
file
format.

Tuning the software for better behavior at low quality/high
compression
settings is also of interest.  The current method for scaling the
quantization tables is known not to be very good at low Q values.

As always, speeding things up is high on our priority list.

Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to
jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions
of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in
describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE
file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the
purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that
remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the
interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or
additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
"submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not
limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
systems,

the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor
and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions
of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in
describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE
file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

34. "Artistic License", for Perl and its components [FOR USE WITH
OPENCL ONLY]:

Artistic License

Copyright (C) 1991-2006 Larry Wall

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus
the right to make reasonable modifications.
Definitions

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created
through textual modification.

"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
Copyright Holder as specified below.

"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights
for the package.

"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
Package.

"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of
media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so
on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder,
but only to the computing community at large as a market that must
bear the fee.)

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means
that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same
conditions they received it.

You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do

at least ONE of the following:

place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to
include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
to get the Standard Version.

accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
Package with your modifications.

give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document
the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with
instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package

as a product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter
within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as
a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard
Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you
do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of
this Package.

C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)
supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate
subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package
shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent
of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change
the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression
tests for the language.

Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces
visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall
not be construed as a distribution of this Package.

The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written
permission.

THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the
purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that
remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the
interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or
additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
"submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not
limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of,
the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor
and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions
of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in
describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE
file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.
This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the
ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it
is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is
that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding
to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library,
without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and
is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.
However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public
License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended
to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to
achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as
regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that
this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.


		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.


  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.


  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.


  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.


  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.


  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as
if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.


  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it
does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA
02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

40. JQUERY-DEV AND JQUERY TABLESORTER[FOR USE WITH QUARTUS II ONLY]:

The following terms only apply to the jquery-dev and jquery
tablesorter portions of the software:

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also
to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,
receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so
they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly
explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals
to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for
those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures
that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer
product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a
particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the
status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A
product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has
substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product
from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified
object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or
for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access
to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules
and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions
of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,
for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose
on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey
a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that
obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you
convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST
OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it
does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published
by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
`show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's
commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL,
see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,
you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser
General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

material term or condition of this Agreement; or (c) becomes insolvent
or seeks protection under any bankruptcy or liquidation or similar
proceedings.
5.2	Upon any termination of this Agreement, the license and rights of
Licensee under this Agreement shall terminate, and Licensee shall
destroy, and shall cause any permitted sublicensees to destroy, the
Deliverables, including all copies and portions thereof in any form
(including any portions thereof merged into a design or Licensed
Product), and certify the same to Altera.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of termination of this Agreement, Licensee
Customers (if the Licensee Type is "Partner") or Licensee (if the
Licensee Type is "End User") may continue to sell and use the systems
containing the Licensed Products that, prior to termination, have been
developed in accordance with this Agreement and shipped to the end
customers of Licensee Customers (if the Licensee Type is "Partner") or
Licensee (if the Licensee Type is "End User").  In no event may any
portions of the Deliverables be used in development after termination.
In the event of termination for any reason, all definitions in this
Agreement and the rights, obligations, and restrictions under Sections
2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12 shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

6.	Consideration:
For the license and other rights granted under this Agreement,
Licensee shall provide the consideration specified by Altera.  Such
consideration shall, as directed by Altera, be provided directly to
Altera or through an authorized distributor.  Licensee shall pay any
and all sales, use, excise, and other tax assessments on the
Deliverables or otherwise arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereunder, exclusive of taxes based on
Altera's net income or corporate or franchise taxes.

7.	Maintenance or Support:
7.1	Unless Licensee has licensed the Deliverables through Altera's
OpenCore Plus Evaluation Program, Altera will, but only until the
date, in the format YYYY.MM, provided in the license file for a
particular MegaCore Function ("Maintenance Expiration Date"): (a) use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Licensee with fixes to
defects in the MegaCore Function that cause the MegaCore Function not
to conform substantially to the Specifications and that are diagnosed
as such and replicated by Altera, (b) provide Licensee with fixes and
other updates to the MegaCore Function that Altera, in its sole
discretion, chooses to make generally available to its customers
without a separate charge; and (c) respond by telephone or email to
inquiries from Licensee.  Altera is not obligated to provide any
maintenance or support for the Deliverables where Licensee has
licensed the Deliverables through Altera's OpenCore Plus Evaluation
Program.
7.2	Except as set forth in Section 7.1 above, Altera will not have any
obligation to provide to Licensee any maintenance, support, or
training, or to provide any error corrections, updates, upgrades, new
versions, other modifications, or enhancements to the Deliverables,
the Altera Devices, or any Licensed Products.  Licensee shall, at its
own expense, be solely responsible for providing technical support and
training to any of its customers and any other end users of the
Deliverables, any Deliverable, or any Licensed Products, and Altera
will have no obligation to any such parties with respect thereto.
Licensee shall be solely responsible for, and Altera shall have no
obligation to honor, any warranties that Licensee provides to its
customers or to any other end users of any Licensed Products.

8.	Confidential Information:
8.1	Licensee acknowledges that the Deliverables contain Confidential
Information of Altera.  Licensee agrees (a) to use at least the same
degree of care as it uses with respect to its own confidential
information, but in no event less than reasonable care, to prevent any
Confidential Information disclosed by Altera from being disclosed to
any third party, except as permitted by this Agreement, (b) not to use
or disclose Altera Confidential Information for any purpose other than
the purpose of programming Altera Devices with the Deliverables (the
"Intended Purpose"), and (c) to restrict disclosure of Altera
Confidential Information solely to those of Licensee's employees and
Contractors (if applicable), each with a need to know for the Intended
Purpose and who agree to be bound by confidential non-disclosure
agreements no less strict than this Agreement, and not disclose it to
other third parties.  Licensee shall be liable to Altera for any
breaches by its employees and Contractors (if applicable).  Licensee
shall not reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Deliverables
that embody Altera Confidential Information.
8.2	Licensee shall have no obligations of confidentiality with respect
to any Confidential Information to the extent that it (a) is already
in the public domain or falls into the public domain through no breach
of this Agreement (or any other obligation to Altera) on the part of
Licensee; (b) is already known to Licensee and is not under any
obligation of confidentiality before receiving such Confidential
Information from Altera; (c) is rightfully obtained by Licensee from a
third party and not under any obligation of confidentiality; or (d) is
developed independently by Licensee by individuals without access to
the Confidential Information.  Licensee may, however, disclose
Confidential Information to the extent required by a court of
competent jurisdiction or an authorized government agency, provided
Altera is given reasonable notice of such disclosure.

9. Limited Representations and Warranties:
9.1	Unless Licensee has acquired the MegaCore Function through
Altera's OpenCore Plus Evaluation Program, Altera represents and
warrants to Licensee that, until the Maintenance Expiration Date
("Warranty Period"), the MegaCore Function will substantially conform
to the Specifications if used in compliance with the terms of this
Agreement.  Licensee's sole remedy, and Altera's sole obligation, for
a breach of this warranty shall be (a) for Altera to use commercially
reasonable efforts to remedy the nonconformance, or (b) if Altera,
after using reasonable commercial efforts, is unable substantially to
remedy the nonconformance, for Licensee to receive a refund of license
fees paid during the previous one (1) year for the defective MegaCore
Function.  If Licensee receive such a refund, Licensee agrees that its
license and rights under this Agreement for the defective MegaCore
Function shall immediately terminate and Licensee agrees to destroy
the defective MegaCore Function, including all copies thereof in any
form and any portions thereof merged into a design or product, and to
certify the same to Altera.
9.2	The foregoing warranties apply only to MegaCore Functions
delivered by Altera or its authorized distributors.  The warranties
are provided only to Licensee, and may not be transferred or extended
to any third party, and apply only during the Warranty Period for
claims of breach reported (together with evidence thereof) during the
Warranty Period.  Licensee shall provide Altera with such evidence of
alleged non-conformities or defects as Altera may request, and Altera
shall have no obligation to remedy any non-conformance or defect it
cannot replicate.  The warranties do not extend to any MegaCore
Function that have been modified by anyone other than Altera or any
authorized distributor.
9.3	ANY MEGACORE FUNCTION OBTAINED BY LICENSEE THROUGH THE OPENCORE
PLUS EVALUATION PROGRAM IS PROVIDED BY ALTERA "AS IS" WITH NO
WARRANTIES.
9.4	Each Party represents to the other Party that it has the right to
enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder.
9.5	EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, NO OTHER
WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE
DELIVERABLES OR SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ALTERA EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
ALL WARRANTIES NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, LICENSEE ASSUMES THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE DELIVERABLES AND ANY DESIGN OR
PRODUCT IN WHICH THE DELIVERABLES MAY BE USED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY LICENSED PRODUCTS.  SHOULD THE DELIVERABLES PROVE
DEFECTIVE, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE DESCRIBED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
ALTERA NOR ITS AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTORS ASSUMES LIABILITY FOR ANY COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.  No representation
or other affirmation of fact, including but limited to statement
regarding capacity, suitability for use or performance of the
Deliverables, whether made by Altera employees or otherwise, shall be
deemed to be a warranty for any purpose or give rise to any liability
of Altera whatsoever.  By making the Deliverables available, Altera
expressly does not recommend, suggest, or require that the
Deliverables be used in combination with any other product not
provided by Altera.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of
implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to Licensee
in full, but shall be interpreted to apply to the maximum extent
permissible under applicable law.

10.	Indemnification:
10.1	Expressly subject to Section 11, and unless Licensee has acquired
the Deliverables through Altera's OpenCore Plus Evaluation License,
Altera shall defend Licensee against any proceeding brought by a third
party to the extent based on a claim that the Deliverables, as
delivered by Altera and as used in accordance with this Agreement,
infringes a third party's United States or European Union copyright,
trade secret or trademark, and pay any damages finally awarded in the
proceeding as a result of the claim (or pay any amount agreed to by
Altera as part of a settlement of the claim), provided that Altera
shall have no liability hereunder unless Licensee notifies Altera
promptly in writing of any such proceeding or claim, gives Altera sole
and complete authority to control the defense and settlement of the
proceeding or claim, and complies with any and all requests by Altera
for information, materials, and other assistance.
10.2	In the event of any such claim or proceeding or threat thereof,
Altera may (and, in the event any such claim or proceeding results in
the issuance of an injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction
prohibiting Licensee from using the Deliverables, Altera shall), at
its option and expense and subject to the limitations of this Section
10 and Section 11, seek a license to permit the continued use of the
Deliverables or affected portion thereof, or use commercially
reasonable efforts to replace or modify the Deliverables so that the
replacement or modified version is non-infringing or has a reduced
likelihood of infringement, provided that the replacement or modified
version has functionality comparable to that of the original.  If
Altera is unable, after exercising reasonable commercial efforts, to
obtain such license or provide such replacement or modification,
Altera may in its sole discretion terminate Licensee's license and
rights with respect to the Deliverables, in which event Licensee shall
return to Altera the Deliverables, including all copies and portions
thereof in any form (including any portions thereof merged into a
design or product), and certify the same to Altera, and Altera shall
refund the license fee, if any, paid by Licensee during the previous
one (1) year for the Deliverables.
10.3	Altera shall have no liability or obligation to Licensee
hereunder for any infringement or claim based on or resulting from (a)
the combination or use of the Deliverables with other products or
components, to the extent that the infringement arises from such
combination or use; (b) modification of the Deliverables by anyone
other than Altera and its authorized distributors, (c) the use of
other than the most recent version of the Deliverables if the
infringement or claim would have been avoided (or the likelihood
thereof reduced) by use of the most recent version; (d) requirements
specified by Licensee; (e) use of Deliverables in any way not
contemplated under this Agreement; or (f) any unauthorized use of the
Deliverables, to the extent that Altera has indicated that third-party
licenses may be required to use such Deliverables.
10.4	The provisions of this Section 10 state the entire liability and
obligations of Altera, and Licensee's sole and exclusive rights and
remedies, with respect to any proceeding or claim relating to
infringement of any intellectual property right.

11.	Limitations of Liability: Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted by law:
11.1	In no event shall the aggregate liability of Altera relating to
this Agreement or the subject matter hereof under any legal theory
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise), including any liability
under Section 10 of this Agreement or for any loss or damages directly
or indirectly suffered by Licensee relating to the Deliverables,
exceed the aggregate amount of the license fees actually paid by
Licensee in the previous one (1) year under this Agreement.
11.2	IN NO EVENT SHALL ALTERA BE LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE (a) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST
REVENUE, OR LOST OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, (b) FOR ANY LOSS OF OR
DAMAGES TO OTHER SOFTWARE OR DATA, OR (c) FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE USE,
SUPPORT, OPERATION, OR FAILURE OF THE DELIVERABLES, WHETHER OR NOT
FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF ALTERA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH LIABILITY AND DAMAGES.
11.3	The limitations set forth in Sections 11.1 and 11.2 above shall
apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited
remedy stated herein.
11.4	Altera is willing to enter into this Agreement only in
consideration of and in reliance upon the provisions contained herein
limiting Altera's exposure to liability.  Such provisions constitute
an essential part of the bargain underlying this Agreement and have
been reflected in the consideration agreed upon by the Parties.  Both
Parties understand and agree that the exclusion of warranties,
limitation of liability, and the limitation of remedies allocate risks
between the Parties as authorized under applicable law.
11.5	To the extent that the Deliverables are developed by a third
party or derived from third-party software, no such third party
provides any representations or warranties with respect to the
Deliverables, assumes any liability regarding use of the Deliverables,
or undertakes to furnish Licensee any support or information relating
to the Deliverables.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Licensee agrees that Altera may disclose Licensee's identity by name
and address, and identify the Deliverables licensed, to the extent
required by agreement with its licensors and partners.

12.	General:
12.1	Altera shall have a right to audit any Licensee records to
confirm Licensee's compliance with its obligations under this
Agreement.  Such audit (a) shall be conducted at Licensee's facilities
at reasonable times upon reasonable prior written notice as needed to
verify Licensee's compliance with its obligations under this
Agreement, and (b) shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's
normal business operations.  This Section 12.1 shall survive for one
(1) year after expiration or termination of this Agreement.
12.2	Licensee may not sublicense, assign, or transfer this Agreement
or the licenses granted, or any rights, duties, or obligations
hereunder, or any Deliverables, whether by operation or law or
otherwise, or disclose any trade secrets or Confidential Information
embodied in the Deliverables, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement. Any attempt to sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer
without prior written consent of the other Party any of the rights,
duties, or obligations hereunder is void.  For the purposes of this
Section, a change in the persons or entities that directly or
indirectly control fifty percent (50%) or more of the equity
securities or beneficial or voting interest of Licensee shall be
considered an assignment by Licensee and shall require the other
Party's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
12.3	Licensee shall not export or re-export, directly or indirectly,
the Deliverables, any part thereof, or the direct product thereof,
including Licensed Products, without first obtaining any necessary
U.S. or other governmental licenses and approvals.  Licensee hereby
gives its assurance to Altera that it will not knowingly, unless prior
authorization is obtained from the appropriate U.S. governmental body,
re-export, directly or indirectly, the Deliverables, any part thereof,
or the direct product thereof, to any the countries or nationals
thereof listed in Country Group E:1, as such list may be amended from
time to time by the U.S. Department of Commerce and/or U.S. Treasury
Department (which list currently includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
Sudan, Syria) or (b) to any end user who has been prohibited from
participating in the U.S. export transactions by any federal agency of
the U.S. government.  Licensee further agrees that no products,
propriety data, know-how, software, or other data or information
received from Altera will be directly employed in missile technology,
sensitive nuclear, chemical or biological weapons end uses or by such
end users.  Licensee understands that the foregoing obligations are
U.S. legal requirements and agree that they shall survive any term or
termination of this Agreement.
12.4	This Agreement is entered into for the benefit of Altera and its
licensors and all rights granted to Licensee and all obligations owed
to Altera shall be enforceable by Altera.
12.5	It is expressly agreed that the validity and construction of this
Agreement, and performance hereunder, shall be governed by the laws of
the State of New York, U.S.A.  The Parties agree to submit to the
jurisdiction of the courts in the State of California, County of Santa
Clara, for the resolution of any dispute or claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement.
12.6	The Parties hereby agree that the Party who does not prevail with
respect to any dispute, claim, or controversy relating to this
Agreement shall pay the costs actually incurred by the prevailing
Party, including any attorneys' fees.
12.7	No amendment to this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in
writing signed by a duly authorized representative of both Parties.
The waiver of any breach or default shall not constitute a waiver of
any other right hereunder.
12.8	If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner adverse to any Party.  Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of
being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
12.9	The article headings throughout this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and the words contained therein shall not be construed
as a substantial part of this Agreement and shall in no way be held to
explain, modify, amplify, or aid in the interpretation, construction,
or meaning of the provisions of this Agreement.
12.10	BY USING THE DELIVERABLES OR ANY PART THEREOF, LICENSEE AND
ALTERA ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LICENSEE AND ALTERA HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT,
UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
LICENSEE AND ALTERA FURTHER AGREE THAT IT IS THE COMPLETE AND
EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN LICENSEE AND ALTERA,
WHICH SUPERSEDES ANY PROPOSAL OR PRIOR AGREEMENT, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND
ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN LICENSEE AND ALTERA RELATING TO THE
SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.
12.11	Licensee agrees (on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries, and
other affiliated parties) that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries
or other affiliated parties will, whether during or after the term of
this Agreement, institute any claim or action against Altera, or any
subsidiaries or other affiliated parties of Altera, that is based in
whole or in part on infringement (whether direct or contributory
infringement, inducement to infringe, or otherwise) of any Licensee
intellectual property rights in connection with the use, license,
offer to license, importing, exporting, or otherwise disposing of the
Deliverables, including any portion, enhancements, modifications, or
derivative works thereof (collectively, "Subject Claims"), or
authorize any third party to file any Subject Claims. This covenant
shall extend to any Subject Claims against third-party manufacturers,
suppliers, distributors, resellers, partners, customers, and other
licensees of Altera or any subsidiaries or other affiliated parties of
Altera. This covenant shall apply to and be binding on any assignees,
licensees, or other transferees of Licensee's intellectual property
rights. To the extent that such covenant shall not automatically be
binding on any such assignees, licensees, or other transferees, the
assigning party shall cause such covenant to be so binding and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Altera, or any subsidiaries or other
affiliated parties of Altera, against all damages, costs, expenses,
and other liabilities (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Altera,
or any subsidiaries or other affiliated parties of Altera, that result
from or relate to any failure to cause such covenant to be so binding.
12.12	If Licensee is an agency or instrumentality of the United States
Government, the Deliverables are "commercial computer software" and
"commercial computer software documentation", and pursuant to FAR
12.212 or DFARS 227.7202, and their successors, as applicable, use,

Version 2, June 1991

59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at
all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
is true depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
under the terms of this License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the
Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
General Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307
USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is
free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
conditions; type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James
Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library,
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

The following license agreement applies only to the Eclipse 3.2.1,
Eclipse 3.3.1, Eclipse CDT 3.1.1, Eclipse CDT 4.0.2, and Jaxb 2
portions of the Nios II EDS software:
Eclipse Public License -v 1.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
alone or when combined with the Program.
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
Agreement, including all Contributors.
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if
any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
license set forth in this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
under its own license agreement, provided that:
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
must pay those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign
the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
Agreement are reserved.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the
purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that
remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the
interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or
additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
"submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not
limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor
and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions
of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in
describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE
file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


The following copyright license applies only to the CPAN -
Math::BigInt 1.89 and CPAN - Math::BigFloat  1.6 portions of the
software:
The "Artistic License"

				Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
	created through textual modification.

	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
	copyrights for the package.

	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
	this Package.

	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
	as a market that must bear the fee.)

	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
	under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of
the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A
Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how
and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of
the
following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet
or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major
archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to
include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not
conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and
provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that
clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on
where
    to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
this
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of
the
interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you
do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is
always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces
visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written
permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR ALTERA SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT FOR OPENCL


1.  License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Altera hereby grants to Licensee a nonexclusive,
nontransferable, nonsublicensable, and temporary license to use the
Licensed Software during the term of this Agreement in connection with
the programming of Altera devices solely for Licensee's internal
evaluation purposes.

2.  Open Source Licenses.  The Licensed Software may contain
particular components, files, or portions that are subject to separate
license agreements with different and/or additional terms and
conditions.  In each such case, the applicable terms and conditions
are set forth in the Open Source License Terms below.  Such individual
terms and conditions exclusively govern the named components, files,
or portions.  By signing this Agreement, Licensee indicates its
acceptance of such terms and conditions.  Acceptance of such terms and
conditions constitutes an acceptance of each such license agreement as
if such license agreement was individually and separately accepted.
The terms and conditions of each of these separate license agreements
are deemed to be the terms and conditions of a standalone license
agreement and do not modify the terms and conditions of such other
license agreements.

3.  License Restrictions; No Implied License.  Licensee shall not use
the Licensed Software except as expressly permitted in this Agreement.
Licensee shall have no rights to modify the Licensed Software.
Licensee is expressly prohibited from: (a) using the Licensed Software
to program any product other than Altera devices, and (b) using the
Licensed Software for any production or production-related purposes.
Except for the rights granted under this Agreement, no license or
other right is grant, either directly or indirectly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise, to Licensee.

4.  AS-IS; No Support.  ALTERA PROVIDES THE LICENSED SOFTWARE ON AN
"AS-IS," "WHERE IS" BASIS. NO WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES, EITHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ALTERA
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, LICENSEE ASSUMES
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED
SOFTWARE AND ANY DESIGN OR PRODUCT IN WHICH THE LICENSED SOFTWARE MAY
BE USED.  SHOULD THE LICENSED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, NEITHER ALTERA
NOR ITS AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTORS ASSUMES LIABILITY FOR ANY COST OF ANY
NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  LICENSEE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE
LICENSED SOFTWARE MAY BE FUNCTION-, TIME- OR CLOCK-CYCLE LIMITED AND
THUS, WITHOUT LIMITING THE EFFECT OF THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
PROVISION CONTAINED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT WILL ALTERA BE HELD LIABLE FOR
ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES TO LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD-PARTY RESULTING FROM
THE AUTOMATIC DISABLING OF ANY LICENSED SOFTWARE OBTAINED UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT.  No representation or other affirmation of fact, including
but limited to statements regarding capacity, suitability for use or
performance of the Licensed Software, whether made by Altera employees
or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a warranty for any purpose or give
rise to any liability of Altera whatsoever.  By making the Licensed
Software available, Altera expressly does not recommend, suggest, or
require that the Licensed Software be used in combination with any
other product not provided by Altera.  Some jurisdictions do not allow
the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not
apply to Licensee in full, but shall be interpreted to apply to the
maximum extent permissible under applicable law.

5.  Title and Ownership.  Altera and its licensors retain all title to
and ownership of the Licensed Software regardless of the form or media
in or on which the original may exist.  Altera also retains all title
to and ownership of any modifications to the Licensed Software made by
Altera.

Software and to use reasonable commercial efforts to report any flaws,
malfunctions, bugs, or other problems with the Licensed Software and
any other testing information or suggestions (collectively, the
Feedback).  By providing the Feedback, Licensee hereby grants and
assigns to Altera, under Licensee's intellectual property rights and
other ownership rights, a worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and
non-exclusive license, with the right to sublicense and to use and
disclose the Feedback in any manner whatsoever, without notice or
obligation to Licensee.

7.  Term and Termination.  This Agreement shall be effective on the
Effective Date and shall terminate 6 months thereafter, unless earlier
terminated in accordance with this paragraph.  Except for a material
breach by Licensee of this Agreement in which the license rights
granted in this Agreement shall terminate immediately, Licensee may
terminate this Agreement at any time by uninstalling and deleting the
Licensed Software and all portions and copies thereof.  Upon
termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall promptly destroy the
Licensed Software and all portions and copies thereof.  The provisions
of paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of this Agreement shall
survive any termination of the Agreement.

8.	Confidentiality.

(a) The Licensed Software constitutes or contains trade secrets and
confidential information of Altera.  Except for Licensee's employees
with a specific need to know, Licensee shall not make the Licensed
Software available in any form to any person or entity.  Licensee
shall take reasonable and appropriate action to protect the
confidentiality of the Licensed Software and ensure that any person
permitted access to the Licensed Software does not disclose the
Licensed Software or use the Licensed Software except as expressly
permitted by this Agreement.  Licensee shall not reverse assemble,
reverse compile, or otherwise reverse engineer the Licensed Software,
in whole or in part.

(b) This Agreement imposes no confidentiality obligations on Licensee
or its employees regarding the Licensed Software that: (i) is in the
public domain or falls into the public domain through no breach of
this Agreement by Licensee or its employees; (ii) is already known to
Licensee without any confidentiality obligations before it receives
the Licensed Software from Altera; (iii) is rightfully obtained by
Licensee from a third party that is not under any confidentiality
obligations; (iv) is provided by Altera to a third party that is not
under any obligation of confidentiality; (v) is developed
independently by Licensee by individuals without access to the
Licensed Software; (vi) is approved for release by written
authorization of Altera; or (vii) is disclosed pursuant to the
requirement of a governmental agency or for which disclosure is
required by operation of law, provided Altera is given reasonable
prior written notice of such intended disclosure.

9.  Limitation of Liability.  ALTERA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY REASON.  EXCEPT FOR A BREACH BY LICENSEE
OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER PARAGRAPHS 1, 2, 3, 8, AND 10 OF THIS SECTION
ENTITLED OTHER TERMS, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

10.  Export.  Licensee shall not export or re-export, directly or
indirectly, the Licensed Software or the direct product thereof
without first obtaining any necessary U.S. or other governmental
licenses and approvals.  Licensee hereby gives its written assurance
that it will not knowingly, unless prior authorization is obtained
from the appropriate U.S. governmental body, re-export, directly or
indirectly, the Licensed Software, or the direct product thereof, (a)
to any of the countries or nationals thereof listed in Country Group
E:1, as such list may be amended from time to time by the
U.S. Department of Commerce and/or U.S. Treasury Department (which
list currently includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria), or (b)
to any end user who has been prohibited from participating in
U.S. export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government.
Licensee further agrees that no products, proprietary data, know-how,
software, or other data, or information received from Altera will be
directly employed in missile technology, sensitive nuclear, chemical,
or biological weapons end uses or by such end users.  Licensee
understands that the foregoing obligations are U.S. legal requirements
and agrees that they shall survive any term or termination of this
Agreement.

11.  General Provisions.  This Agreement contains the entire agreement
between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter and supersedes
any previous understandings, commitments, or agreements, oral or
written concerning the subject matter of this Agreement.  Altera's
failure to enforce any right resulting from breach of any provision of
this Agreement by Licensee will not be deemed a waiver of any right
relating to a subsequent breach of such provision or of any other
right hereunder.  If any provision of this Agreement is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable,
the remaining provisions will nevertheless continue in full force
without being impaired or invalidated in any way.  This Agreement
shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without
regard to its conflict of law of choice of law principles.  The courts
in the State of California shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
resolve any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, and the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such
courts.

OPEN SOURCE LICENSE TERMS

This Exhibit contains 15 separate licensing agreements.  Acceptance of
these terms and conditions constitutes an acceptance of each of these 15

10.  Artistic License, for Perl and its components

Artistic License

Copyright (C) 1991-2006 Larry Wall

Preamble 

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus
the right to make reasonable modifications. 
Definitions

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created
through textual modification.

"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
Copyright Holder as specified below.

"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights
for the package.

"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
Package.

"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of
media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so
on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder,
but only to the computing community at large as a market that must
bear the fee.)

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means
that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same
conditions they received it.

You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
 
at least ONE of the following:

place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to
include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
documents how it differs from the Standard Version.  

make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
to get the Standard Version.

accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
Package with your modifications.

give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document
the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with
instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package
 
as a product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter
within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as
a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard
Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                Version 2, June 1991

    Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
    numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                Preamble

     The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
   freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
   Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
   free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

     This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
   specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
   other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
   your libraries, too.

     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
   price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
   have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
   this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
   if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
   in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
   anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
   These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
   you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

     For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
   or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
   you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
   complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
   with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
   it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

     Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
   the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
   permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

     Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
   that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
   library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
   want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
   version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
   the original authors' reputations.

     Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
   patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
   software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
   transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
   we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
   free use or not licensed at all.

     Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
   GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
   license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
   designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
   one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
   the same as in the ordinary license.

     The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
   they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
   program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
   changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
   analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
   a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
   derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
   treats it as such.

     Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
   Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
   sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
   concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

     However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
   users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
   libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
   permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
   preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
   libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
   this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
   changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
   will lead to faster development of free libraries.

     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
   "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
   former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
   works together with the library.

     Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
   General Public License rather than by this special one.
   
           GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

     0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
   party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
   General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
   addressed as "you".

     A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
   prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
   (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
   which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
   Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
   copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
   portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".)

     "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
   all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
   interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
   and installation of the library.

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
   running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
   such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
   on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
   writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
   and what the program that uses the Library does.
     
     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
   all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
   warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
   Library.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
   and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
   fee.
   
     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

       b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
       its purpose remains meaningful.

       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
       root function must still compute square roots.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
   and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
   sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
   on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
   this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Library.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
   with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
   a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
   the scope of this License.

     3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
   that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
   instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
   that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
   these notices.

     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
   that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
   the Library into a program that is not a library.

     4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
   derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
   under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
   it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
   must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
   medium customarily used for software interchange.

     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
   from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
   distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
   compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

     5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
   Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
   linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
   work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
   therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

     However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
   contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
   library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
   Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

     When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
   structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
   functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
   file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
   work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
   Library will still fall under Section 6.)

     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
   Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
   whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

     6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
   link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
   work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
   under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
   modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications.

     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
   this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
   during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
   directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
   of these things:

       a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
       executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
       that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
       Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
       to use the modified definitions.)

       b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
       least three years, to give the same user the materials
       specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
       than the cost of performing this distribution.

       c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
       specified materials from the same place.

       d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

     For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
   Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
   reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
   the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
   distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
   which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
   the executable.

     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
   restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
   accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
   use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
   distribute.

     7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
   facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
   library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
   the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
   permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

       a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
       facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
       Sections above.

       b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
       that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
       where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

     8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
   the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
   attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
   distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
   rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
   or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

     9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the Library or works based on it.

     10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
   subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
   this License.

     11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
   license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
   all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
   the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
   and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system which is
   implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
   generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
   through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
   system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
   to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
   impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.

     12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
   an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
   so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
   written in the body of this License.

     13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
   Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
   "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
   license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
   the Free Software Foundation.

     14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
   write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
   Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
   decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
   of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
   and reuse of software generally.

                NO WARRANTY

     15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
   LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
   THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

     16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
   AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
   FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
   LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
   RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
   FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
   SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

     If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
   possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
   everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
   redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
   ordinary General Public License).

     To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
   safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
   convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
   "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

       <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
       Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

       This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
       modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
       License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
       version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

       This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
       but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
       MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
       Library General Public License for more details.

       You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
       License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
       Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
   school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
   necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
     library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

     <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   That's all there is to it!
